  head: takes a list and returns its head. The head of a list is basically its first element.
  tail: takes a list and returns its tail. In other words, it chops off a list's head.
  last: takes a list and returns its last element.
  init: takes a list and returns everything except its last element.
  length: takes a list and returns its length, obviously.
  null: checks if a list is empty.
  reverse: reverses a list.
  take: takes number and a list. It extracts that many elements from the beginning of the list.(take 3 â€“ takes first three elements from the list)
  drop: works in a similar way, only it drops the number of elements from the beginning of a list.
  maximum: takes a list of stuff that can be put in some kind of order and returns the biggest element.
  minimum: returns the smallest.
  sum: takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.
  product: takes a list of numbers and returns their product.
  elem: takes a thing and a list of things and tells us if that thing is an element of the list. It's usually called as an infix function because it's easier to read that way.
  cycle: takes a list and cycles it into an infinite list. If you just try to display the result, it will go on forever so you have to slice it off somewhere.
  repeat: takes an element and produces an infinite list of just that element. It's like cycling a list with only one element.
  replicate: function if you want some number of the same element in a list. replicate 3 10 returns [10,10,10].
